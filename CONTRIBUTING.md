Until an initial working cut is complete, the contribution guidelines are as follows:

1. Don't break the sim. Functionality can be missing, but do your best to avoid the system crashing or being unable to run.
2. Please write good code. Consider reading [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the Python Coding Guidelines. Please consider striving for Pythonic code, and avoiding ninja comments.
